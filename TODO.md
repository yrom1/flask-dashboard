- [x] Remove `print`s and `console.log`s
- [x] Stop trying to render graphs on each page, this quick fix now makes the non-dashboard pages load slower
- [ ] Now that dashboard isnt tried to be rendered on each page, setting the theme using javascript is quite messy, use CSS @media instead
- [ ] Look into regression of andon colors updating automatically (possibly)
- [ ] A really cool plot would be a dot plot with days of the month and what color status the thing was at the end for each day, idk if 3 dot plots, I was thinking just one. Maybe each metric is: `status(metric): red = -1, yellow = 0, green = 1`, `overall([metrics]): round(sum(metrics)/len(metrics))`
    - [x] this might mean having redo the schema to a star schema with foreign key for each metric... ya this is a good excuse to refactor the database into aws mysql perhaps
- [ ] Number of LeetCode questions done is a bad metric I've come to realize. Activity would be better even if it's slightly more dubious in meaning. I'd rather redo questions more often than I currently am I can't memorize 600 solutison.
  - [ ] Can I group all SQL dialect activity into a single thing? That would be nice if I want to practice diffent dialects on offer on LC...
