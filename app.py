        <h2>Dashboard explanation</h2>
        <p>This dashboard tracks some useful metrics about myself, specifically:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The first graph is about Jira, issue tracking software. I find it helpful to see how much effort I've been exerting recently, measured by the number of Jira issues completed, i.e. put in the 'Done' column of a Jira kanban board.</li>
            <li>The middle graph pertains to LeetCode, a programming practice problem site. Knowing how many questions I've done the past week is helpful to see if I'm hitting my desired pace. It helps me choose if I should practice Python or SQL on a given day. And seeing my progress over a long period of time is good motivation.</li>
            <li>The last graph pertains to Strava, a GPS run tracking app. I find this graph particularly useful to know how many days it's been since I ran last, which is an easy thing to forget. Also, it's helpful to see the distance I ran, to see if I'm making any progress.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Source code</h2>
        The general idea for this dashboard is about using Github Actions to run Python scripts to update these graph image files, and if needed gather data and store it in a SQLite database.

    <p>This is a wonderful talk by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_M._Beazley">David Beazley</a>, and despite being a very old talk is still up to date because it was about an early version of Python3 at the time. One of the exercises left to the reader in this tutorial is to make a class decorator that works with <code>@staticmethod</code>s, and <code>@classmethod</code>s, something that you actually don't see a lot. And that challenge was what inspired me to make my exception logging package on PyPI (<a href="https://pypi.org/project/exlog/">exlog</a>). And I'm glad I did, because otherwise I wouldn't of understood why class decorators and metaclasses work together so seamlessly.</p>

    <p>I would give two downsides about auditing this course, which I should note I thought was otherwise very excellent:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The C++ assignments are checked for correctness using an internal system (BusTub) that is unavailable to the public, which is slightly sad because they looked fun.</li>
        <li>While there are many time where Andy Pavlo goes out of his way to show differences in the behavior of different datebases (specifically MySQL, Postgres, and Oracle if I remember), which was often interesting and funny, at the end of the course I didn't feel like I a solid understanding of how exactly specific DBMSs worked internally.</li>
    </ul>
    As I'm not looking for a systems developer role any time soon, the first point isn't the end of the world. For the second point, and while it's just a start, an Uber Engineering blogpost '<a href="https://www.uber.com/en-CA/blog/postgres-to-mysql-migration/">Why Uber Engineering Switched from Postgres to MySQL</a>'...
