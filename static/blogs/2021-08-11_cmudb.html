<p>A <a href="https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2019/">great database course</a> is given by <a href="https://twitter.com/andy_pavlo">Andy Pavlo</a>, who is objectively hilarious. His course begins by him presenting from his bathtub during COVID:</p>

<p>I would give two downsides about auditing this course, which I should note I thought was otherwise very excellent:</p>
<ul>
<li>The C++ assignments are checked for correctness using an internal system (BusTub) that is unavailable to the public, which is slightly sad because they looked fun.</li>
<li>While there are many time where Andy Pavlo goes out of his way to show differences in the behavior of different datebases (specifically MySQL, Postgres, and Oracle if I remember), which was often interesting and funny, at the end of the course I didn't feel like I a solid understanding of how exactly specific DBMSs worked internally.</li>
</ul>
<p>As I'm not looking for a systems developer role any time soon, the first point isn't the end of the world. For the second point, and while it's just a start, an Uber Engineering blogpost '<a href="https://www.uber.com/en-CA/blog/postgres-to-mysql-migration/">Why Uber Engineering Switched from Postgres to MySQL</a>' I felt did a solid job explaining some specific details about how MySQL and Postgres are implemented.</p>
