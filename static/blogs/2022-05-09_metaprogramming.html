<h1>Python3 Metaprogramming</h1>
<time>2022-05-09</time>
<p>This is a wonderful talk by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_M._Beazley">David Beazley</a>, and despite being a very old talk is still up to date because it was about an early version of Python3 at the time. One of the exercises left to the reader in this tutorial is to make a class decorator that works with <code>@staticmethod</code>s, and <code>@classmethod</code>s, something that you actually don't see a lot. And that challenge was what inspired me to make my exception logging package on PyPI (<a href="https://pypi.org/project/exlog/">exlog</a>). And I'm glad I did, because otherwise I wouldn't of understood why class decorators and metaclasses work together so seamlessly.</p>
